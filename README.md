# Ruby World Generator

This project exists to aid my growth in writing clean, object-oriented ruby code.

The user will be able to run this program from the terminal and generate interesting and beautiful world maps using text and color.

## Features

The user can: 
 - generate a new world with a cool name
 - scroll along the x/y axis to explore the world
 - Zoom in/and out to explore the world
 - label and name tiles in the world

 ## Run it!

 `$ bundle install`     
 `$ bundle exec ruby lib/run.rb`
